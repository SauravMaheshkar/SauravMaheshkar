## Hello, I'm [Saurav](https://sauravmaheshkar.github.io/) 👋

* 🐝 I am a Computer Science student at the University of Manchester.
* 👨‍🎓 I am interested in Geometric Learning and Self Supervised Learning.
* 📣 I am a Google Developer Expert in Machine Learning [@ml-gde](https://github.com/ml-gde).
* 🚀 I actively contribute to the JAX and PyG ecosystem.
* 👬 I'd love to collaborate on Open Source Implementations of Self Supervised Learning or GNN projects.
* 📟 Feel free to reach out via email at: `sauravvmaheshkar <at> gmail.com` or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MaheshkarSaurav).


Some projects that I like to highlight:

* [`SauravMaheshkar/hivegraph`](https://github.com/SauravMaheshkar/hivegraph): Python Framework built on PyTorch and PyTorch Geometric for working with Representation Learning on Graph Neural Networks.
* [`SauravMaheshkar/HyperGraphLearning`](https://github.com/SauravMaheshkar/HyperGraphLearning): On going study of Hyper Graph Representation Learning.

I also love to work on developer tooling and computer science fundamentals. 

* [`SauravMaheshkar/python-template`](https://github.com/SauravMaheshkar/python-template): General Purpose Repository Template for Python Projects 🐍, bootstrapped with [pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com/), [just](https://github.com/casey/just), [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for python deps management and optimised GA workflows for python development.
* [`SauravMaheshkar/verilog-template`](https://github.com/SauravMaheshkar/verilog-template): A Template for Verilog Projects (using `iverilog` and `gtkwave`) with test infrastructure (nix devShell ❄️ supported).
* [`SauravMaheshkar/dotfiles`](https://github.com/SauravMaheshkar/dotfiles): My ❄️ Nix-darwin dotfiles.
* [`SauravMaheshkar/sat-rs`](https://github.com/SauravMaheshkar/sat-rs): A SAT solver written in Rust 🦀.
* [`SauravMaheshkar/jangal-rs`](https://github.com/SauravMaheshkar/jangal-rs): Efficient Tree Data Structures in Rust 🦀.
* [`SauravMaheshkar/hypergraph.pl`](https://github.com/SauravMaheshkar/hypergraph.pl): Hypergraph structure implementation in Prolog 🧑‍💻.
* [`SauravMaheshkar/playground`](https://github.com/SauravMaheshkar/playground): Multi-language Leetcode infrastructure.
