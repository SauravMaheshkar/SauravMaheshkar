Hi there, My name is [Saurav](https://sauravmaheshkar.github.io/)

I am a Computer Science student at the University of Manchester and am interested in Geometric Learning and Self Supervised Learning. Currently, I am working on:

* [Benchmarking Self Supervised Learning Methods](https://github.com/SauravMaheshkar/Self-Supervised-Learning)
* [Self Supervised Learning Methods for Graphs](https://github.com/SauravMaheshkar/SSL-Graphs)
* Knowledge Distillation Deep Dive (Teacher Size vs Student Size. ViT vs Conv vs MLPs)
* Generative models for regulatory DNA sequences based on diffusion models
